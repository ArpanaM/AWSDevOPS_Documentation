# Introduction to Virtualization and Cloud Computing


## · What is Internet: 
A global computer network using standardized 
communication protocols (e.g. UDP, TCP/IP) providing information and 
communication facilities.

## Local Network: Private network in LAN (Local Area Network)

## · Virtualization: 
Run multiple OSs on a host machine (Type 1: BareMetal, Uses Hypervisor OS (e.g. ESXi) and Type 2: Application running on another base OS (e.g. vmware workstation)).

## Virtual Machine: 
Software representation of virtual computer as set of files! Easy 
to move, independent of hardware, Effective utilization of resources. We can do 
virtual networking between VMs.

## · Data Center:
Data centers are simply centralized locations where computing and 
networking equipment is concentrated for the purpose of collecting, storing, 
processing, distributing or allowing access to large amounts of data.
## · What is Cloud? 
There is now Cloud, it is someone else's computer accessible over the Internet! Virtual Machine running on a cloud server is the most widely used way of hosting any applications online.

## · Cloud Computing: 
On demand delivery of IT resources via the Interment, Instead of setting up Physical DCs, we can access Compute, Network, Storage on demand basis from Cloud providers. Use cases: Data backup, DRS, Email, Virtual Desktop, Software Development, Testing, Web Apps, Online Gaming, IoT, etc. Worldwide availability
