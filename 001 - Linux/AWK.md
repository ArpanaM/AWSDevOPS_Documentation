# AWK

## Introduction


- Awk is a scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports. The awk command programming language requires no compiling and allows the user to use variables, numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators.

- Awk is a utility that enables a programmer to write tiny but effective programs in the form of statements that define text patterns that are to be searched for in each line of a document and the action that is to be taken when a match is found within a line.

- Awk is mostly used for pattern scanning and processing. It searches one or more files to see if they contain lines that matches with the specified patterns and then perform the associated actions. 

- Awk is abbreviated from the names of the developers â€“ Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan.

- AWK gets its name from the initials of its creators: Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan.

*Text Processing:* AWK is primarily used for text processing. It reads text line by line and performs actions based on specified patterns and rules.

*Fields and Records:* AWK divides each line into fields and each line into records. By default, fields are separated by spaces or tabs, and records are lines.

*Pattern-Action Pairs:* AWK programs consist of pattern-action pairs. If a line matches a pattern, the associated action is executed.
